# cplusplus

This project is a versioned playground to do some practice with coding and compilation tools

The root folder here is the main source folder, and is under version control
Build is meant to happen somewhere out
-- parent

   -- cplusplus <-- this one is under version control, all source code, versioned hand-made makefiles, CMakeLists live here 
   |
   -- build_cplusplus <-- this one is NOT under version control, can be created by user (or by make scripts) to compile and hold compiled code
